# Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of online learning, game theory, and computer networks. I am particularly interested in developing theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for intelligent network systems.

## Main Research Areas

### Online Learning and Bandit Algorithms
I work on multi-armed bandit problems and their applications in network optimization. My research includes:
- Contextual bandit algorithms for dynamic network environments
- Thompson Sampling with differential privacy guarantees
- Regret minimization in non-stationary environments

### Game Theory for Networks
I explore game-theoretic approaches to network resource allocation and protocol design:
- Mechanism design for distributed systems
- Nash equilibrium analysis in network games
- Incentive-compatible protocols

### Applications in Computer Networks
My work bridges theory and practice in:
- Adaptive routing and load balancing
- Quality of Service (QoS) optimization
- Edge computing and content delivery

## Current Projects

### Differentially Private Multi-Armed Bandits
Developing privacy-preserving online learning algorithms that maintain strong theoretical guarantees while protecting user data in networked systems.

### Intelligent Network Resource Allocation
Designing adaptive algorithms for resource allocation in cloud and edge computing environments using online learning techniques.

### Game-Theoretic Analysis of Network Protocols
Analyzing the strategic behavior of network participants and designing incentive-compatible mechanisms for efficient network operation.

## Collaborations

I collaborate with researchers from various institutions and industry partners to apply theoretical insights to real-world network problems. My work spans both fundamental research and practical system implementation.
