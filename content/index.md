## About

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria, BC, Canada, advised by Dr. Jianping Pan. I obtained my MSc in Computer Science from the same university in 2020, and BEng in Communications Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China in 2018. My research is focused on online learning, especially for bandit algorithms, and game theory, with their applications in computer networks.
