      <description>The project is maintained by PanLab at University of Victoria, Canada, supervised by Prof.Jianping Pan and Prof.Ruonan Zhang. The research mainly on clustering multipath components in radio channel by applying methods from machine learning.
I had a 3-months research internship in Panlab, where I focus my work on how to improve the clustering performance of multipath components(MPCs) in radio channel. My first work is a modification to an existing clusering methods called Fuzzy C-means algorithm to enable it to fit in clustering MPCs situation.</description>

      <description>The project is maintained by wireless communication Lab at Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by Prof.Ruonan Zhang and Prof.Bin Li. The project focuses on improving the communication distane between a Base Station (BS) on the ground and a Mobile Station(MS) on a Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV).
I joined this team in 2016.3. My job is to Conducted field experiment, Established and monitored the communication systems. The figure below shows the system we paid attention to.</description>

      <description>The project is maintained by Intelligent Information Lab at Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by Prof.Yong Deng and Prof.Wen Jiang. The research mainly on fields of Evidence theory, Complexity Network, Fuzzy Set Theory, Bio-inspired AI, etc.
I joined this team in 2015.9. At first my research interests focus on processing multiple evaluations from experts and solve the confliction among opinions. Here is a published paper in Soft Computing. This paper proposed a method that allows experts give ambiguous evaluation and by combining different experts&amp;rsquo; opinons up, a defuzziation output can be achieved.</description>
