<h4 id="advisor-prof-jianping-pan">Huang, Z., Hu, B., &amp; Pan, J., Minor Revisions to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communication</h4>
<p>The burgeoning network traffic imposes a huge burden on the network backbone. Caching popular files at the wireless network edge is promising to address the problem. 
  In practice, file popularity is very unlikely to know in advance. Online learning algorithms are effective to learn this uncertainty in a sequential way.  In each slot, the learning agent generates a caching policy (\ie the to-be-cached files) and can observe users' feedback about the caching policy within the same slot. This method  implicitly requires that all of the users are able to provide feedback promptly.
  However, in practice, the availability of each individual user is affected by many factors, \eg users are moving out of the service area temporarily, or they may still consume files in the previous slots, which may result in the feedback delay.
  In this paper, we propose a delay-tolerant wireless caching system that takes both the feedback delay and users' availability into consideration. We frame the content caching problem as \emph{a stochastic combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem with delayed feedback and forced-to-sleep arms}, and devise an intelligent caching algorithm called CFAUD to solve the problem. Also, we show that CFAUD is effective and efficient both theoretically and practically. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other well-known algorithms.</p>

<h4 id="advisors-prof-wen-jiang-prof-yong-deng">Advisors: <a href="https://dianzi.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1270/5979.htm">Prof. Wen Jiang</a>, <a href="http://en.uestc.edu.cn/index.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=show&amp;catid=79&amp;id=5320">Prof. Yong Deng</a></h4>
<p>Bayesian Networks are a kind of probabilistic graphical model, which can be used for inference. The quantum probability theory is an extension of classic probability theory, where the probability of an event is characterized by the square of the absolute value of a complex number. Currently, Bayesian Networks are based on the classic probability theory. Applying the quantum probability in Bayesian Networks strengthens the inference ability. We are interested to solve fundamental problems encountered in the collision of Bayesian Networks and the quantum probability theory.</p>

<h4 id="advisors-prof-wen-jiang-prof-yong-deng-1">Advisors: <a href="https://dianzi.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1270/5979.htm">Prof. Wen Jiang</a>, <a href="http://en.uestc.edu.cn/index.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=show&amp;catid=79&amp;id=5320">Prof. Yong Deng</a></h4>
<p>Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FEMA) is a useful framework for the fault diagnosis and decision making. FEMA evaluates each underlying fault from three aspects: Occurence, Severity, and Detection, and generates risk priority number for desicion making.  However, traditional FEMA is single-expert based, and relies on precise grading by the expert. Practically, there might be multiple experts who can only provide fuzzy information for FEMA. We are motivated to develop tools to utilize the multi-fuzzy gradings based on information fusion techniques.</p>
